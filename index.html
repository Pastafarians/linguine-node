      <h3>Project Synopsis</h3>
      <p>The LinGUIne tool is an open source web application that can be used to perform language
      analysis on large sets of input data. With a heavy focus on visualization, several language 
      processing techniques can be applied to a collection of formatted texts known as corpora. The 
      application can then identify useful patterns and perform many predefined language analysis 
      techniques.
      LinGUIne aims to be user friendly and to eliminate the need to know complex algorithms 
      in order to perform language analysis tasks. This is accomplished by taking the user through a 
      simple application flow where they are able to upload their corpora, select options to format the 
      series of texts, choose which analysis to perform, and to export graphic visualizations as well as 
      raw data for further analysis. This workflow allows the tool to be used by beginners and experts 
      alike, introducing newer language scientists to their common set of tools while still being flexible 
      enough for more experienced users to continue working with results exported from the tool.  
      The project has been in progress for two academic years and already supports a limited 
      set of analysis and visualizations. The team’s goal for the 2015­16 academic year is to Include a 
      more robust suite of analysis techniques, and to pair each technique with relevant graphical 
      output. By improving the overall usability and feature set of the strong base developed by 
      previous senior project teams, LinGUIne stands as a powerful tool in language science 
      education.
